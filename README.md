# mapTheSong
In the search bar you can write the name of a song you are interested in and the program is going to take from the tag data all the JsonObjects that contain that song.
After retrieving this data, I want to analize it and group the data by how many people have shazamed that song in each city.
Then I want to draw circles on the map, the more people listen to the song the bigger the circle will be.
